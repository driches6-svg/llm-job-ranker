# Contract Role Ranker (Phase 1)

Ingest, deduplicate, and store contract job listings from JobServe (via Apiify) into AWS S3.  
This is the first phase of a pipeline that will later enrich listings with LLM scoring and ranking.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture (Phase 1)

- **AWS Lambda (Ingest)**
  - Triggered on a schedule (EventBridge).
  - Pulls listings from Apiify (JobServe scraper API).
  - Computes a stable `job_id` for each listing.
  - Checks DynamoDB to avoid duplicates.
  - Writes **partitioned Parquet files** to S3.

- **AWS S3**
  - Storage for listings, partitioned by `year/month/day/hour`.
  - Encrypted at rest (AES-256).

- **AWS DynamoDB**
  - Lightweight deduplication store.
  - Each `job_id` stored with TTL (default 120 days) to expire old jobs automatically.

- **Athena (later)**
  - Query-ready dataset thanks to Parquet + Hive-style partitions.
